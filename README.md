# Button Randomly Project

This is a simple project consisting of a button that, when clicked, moves randomly from its initial position within the page. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and create click events.

## How to Run

To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. When trying to click the "No" button, it will randomly move to a new location, leaving you with no choice but to click "Yes".
